# Quadtree Demo

A demo to showcase my [Quadtree JS Library](https://github.com/oyed/quadtree).

## Usage

There are two demos here - one using a traditional, simple method of checking collisions, and one with the Quadtree. You can find them here:

- [Traditional Collision checking](https://quadtree.oyed.io/#bad)
- [Quadtree Collision checking](https://quadtree.oyed.io/)
